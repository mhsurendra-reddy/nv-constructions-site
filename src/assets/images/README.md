# Images Folder

## Required Images

### Logo
Place your company logo as `logo.png` or `logo.jpg` in this folder.

The logo should ideally be:
- Transparent background (PNG format)
- Dimensions: around 200x80 pixels or similar aspect ratio
- High quality for best results

### Project Images (Optional)
You can also add your actual project images here and reference them in the ProjectGallery component.

## Current Setup
- `logo.svg` - A placeholder SVG logo (you can replace this with your actual logo)
- You can use PNG, JPG, or SVG formats

## How to Use
In your components, import images like this:
```tsx
import logo from '../../../assets/images/logo.png';
// or
import logo from '../../../assets/images/logo.svg';
```
